    "text_dolomiti":"The Natural World Heritage Site includes nine mountain systems in the Italian Alps, a series of unique mountain landscapes of outstanding natural beauty. The Dolomites originated in the Triassic (about 250 million years ago) from the accumulation of shells, corals, and algae in areas of a different latitude and longitude than the one today, where warm and shallow seas existed. These sediments were then transformed into rock and the subsequent collision between the European plate and the African plate caused the rocks to emerge, raising them to over 3000 meters above sea level. The Unesco recognition rewards the extraordinary landscape and naturalistic value of the Dolomites, their charm and beauty.",
